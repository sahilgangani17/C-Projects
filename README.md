# C-Projects
<p>I created these projects in my first year of diploma studies to strengthen my understanding of C programming basics.</p>

<h3>Projects Included:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe Game:</strong> A two-player game where users take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game includes input validation and checks for a winner or a tie after each turn.</li>
  <li><strong>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:</strong> A simple game where the user competes against the computer. It includes random choice generation for the computer, user input, and logic to determine the winner.</li>
</ul>

<p>These games helped me understand concepts like conditional statements, loops, functions, and arrays. They also introduced me to the basics of game logic and algorithm development.</p>
